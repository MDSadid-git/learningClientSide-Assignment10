      <h3>Why An FAQ Resource?</h3>
      <p>
        Firstly, FAQ pages can bring new visitors to your website via organic
        search and drive them quickly to related pages – most typically deeper
        blog pages and service pages closely related to the questions being
        resolved. Next, one of the most significant opportunities for impactful
        brand visibility within the search engine result pages (in-SERP) is
        targeting audience questions, wants, needs, and pain points. The FAQ
        page is one of the best ways to help people visit your site and get
        snippets of answers in front of users before they click any results
        within the search pages.
